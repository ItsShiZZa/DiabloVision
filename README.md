You can either use the app or the .CT Cheat Engine cheat table with Cheat Engine. Only for use in single player.
It's recommended you firewall your D2R.exe game executable off with Windows Firewall before use if you want to be absolutely safe.
If you use this on Battle.net, you will almost certainly be banned.

NOTE: In your Cheat Engine settings, you may need to ensure that MEM_MAPPED under Scan Settings is checked. The option that needs to be check says "MEM_MAPPED:Memory that is mapped into the view of a section (Eg File mapping, emulator memory, slow)"
